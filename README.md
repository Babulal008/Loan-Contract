**LoanContract** is a Solidity-based smart contract designed for issuing and repaying loans on the Ethereum blockchain.

The `Loan` struct stores all loan-related details:

```solidity
struct Loan {
    uint256 amount;         // Principal loan amount
    uint256 interestRate;   // Interest rate in percentage (8%)
    uint256 dueAmount;      // Total due amount (principal + interest)
    uint256 dueDate;        // Repayment deadline (30 days from issuance)
    uint256 amountPaid;     // Total repaid amount
}
